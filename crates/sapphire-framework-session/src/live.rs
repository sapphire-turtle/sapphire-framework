//! The phase after `Done`: a session that stays open and pushes what is committed.
//!
//! [`open_live_session`] runs the same initial exchange as [`crate::run_session`] and then,
//! instead of closing the stream, keeps reading it. `Live` messages are applied as they
//! arrive and published on a broadcast, and [`LiveSession::push`] sends a batch through the
//! same writer task the exchange used. The two ends of one session are two independent
//! `LiveSession`s: each side pushes what it commits and applies what arrives, and neither is
//! a client.
//!
//! Content does not travel inside a `Live` message. A batch that names a file this side does
//! not have is answered with `Want` on the same stream, and the peer's `Blob` settles it
//! through the machinery the exchange already uses. A batch is published only once every
//! hash it was waiting on has been answered, so a host that forwards what it receives never
//! announces an entry it cannot serve.
//!
//! # A dead peer must not stall the others
//!
//! The write half belongs to one task fed by a bounded channel, so a peer that stopped
//! reading only fills its own queue. [`LiveSession::push`] fails at once once the session has
//! closed, so a caller looping over peers moves on to the next one instead of waiting on one
//! that went away.
