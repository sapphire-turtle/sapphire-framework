//! The workgroup's own workspace, replicated like any other workspace.
//!
//! The device ledger and the workspace list live inside the workgroup root, so a pairing on
//! one device reaches the rest by the same replication every other workspace uses. The
//! bridge is the app server that owns this workspace: it scans it, and it serves a
//! replication session to any peer the data plane hands it.
//!
//! Serving is only half of being an owner. The [`spawn_driver`] task is the other half: it
//! watches the workgroup root, records every local change with a scan, and runs a
//! replication session with every peer that has a greater device id — so an admission or a
//! retirement written here reaches the running bridges of the workgroup without anyone
//! doing it by hand.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-process-architecture-design.md` §1: the bridge is
//! the app server of one app, and that app is the workgroup.
