# Bridge Basics (`sapphire-framework-bridge`) Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.
>
> If your harness has no such skill, execute the tasks in order, one at a time, running the
> listed commands and committing at the end of each task. Do not skip the "run the test and
> watch it fail" steps: they are what proves the test exercises the new code.

**Goal:** Build the host-wide daemon every app server talks to — device identity, workgroup
authorization, and a switchboard that splices a peer's connection to whichever app server owns
the workspace it asked for — as the new crates `sapphire-framework-bridge-api` and
`sapphire-framework-bridge`, plus the `sapphire-bridge` binary.

**Architecture:** Two listeners in one process. The **control plane** is JSON-RPC over the
bridge's own endpoint: app servers register the workspaces they own, and the bridge tells them
when a peer wants one. The **data plane** is a second endpoint where a connection sends one
header line and then becomes raw bytes, spliced to an iroh stream. Between the two sits a
routing table from workspace to owner. The bridge holds no application replication state:
merging and file writing happen at the ends, and this process only moves bytes between them.
Peer transport is a trait, so every task but one is tested without a network.

**Tech Stack:** Rust 2024 (toolchain 1.98.0), `sapphire-framework-ipc`,
`sapphire-framework-registry`, `sapphire-framework-sync`, iroh 1.2, tokio 1, serde + toml +
serde_json, grain-id 0.16, clap 4, thiserror 2, tracing; dev: tempfile 3.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-process-architecture-design.md` — §5 in full,
§4.3 (the control and data planes as the app server sees them), §1 (what the bridge owns).
Implementation order step 6 of that spec's §9. The surviving material of
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-p2p-sync-iroh-design.md` §3.1, §3.4, §3.5 and §3.8 applies,
read through the substitution table at the head of its §3.

**Depends on:** steps 2 (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-16-registry-devices-plan.md`),
3 (`2026-09-16-ipc-layer-plan.md`) and 4 (`2026-09-16-app-server-plan.md`) must be complete.

**Branch:** work on `feat/p2p-sync-iroh` (the current branch).

## Global Constraints

- Code, comments, commit messages and tests in **English** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`).
- CI runs `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
  and `cargo test --all-features --locked`. All three must pass after every task. Commit
  `Cargo.lock` whenever dependencies change.
- Every public item carries a doc comment; both crates have `#![warn(missing_docs)]`.
- `sapphire-framework-bridge` must **not** depend on `-workspace`, `-retrieve` or `-backend`.
  The bridge never looks inside a workspace. A test pins this.
- The bridge directory is `<dirs::data_dir()>/sapphire/bridge/`, overridden whole by
  `SAPPHIRE_BRIDGE_DIR`. Mode `0700` on Unix, like everything else the framework creates.
- `BRIDGE_FORMAT_VERSION` is `1`. A directory whose `format` is newer stops the bridge; an
  older one is migrated before anything else runs.
- Identifiers a user can see or type are grain-ids (`workgroup_id`, `workspace_id`,
  `device_id`). A node id is iroh's, 64 lowercase hex characters, carried as a string
  everywhere outside the iroh transport.
- The ALPN is `sapphire/ws/1`.
- **Pairing, invites and `workgroup join` are step 8**, not here. This plan includes only
  `workgroup create`, because without a workgroup nothing can be authorized and nothing can be
  tested.

## Two deviations from the spec, agreed up front

1. **The control-plane types live in their own crate, `sapphire-framework-bridge-api`.** The
   spec §6 says they sit behind a dependency-light `client` feature of `-bridge`. That does
   not hold: Cargo unifies features across a workspace build, so the moment the `sapphire-bridge`
   binary turns iroh on, every other crate in the same build links a `-bridge` that contains
   it. A separate serde-only crate makes "the app server does not pull in iroh" a fact rather
   than an intention.
2. **Inbound streams are announced, not pushed.** The spec §4.3 shows the bridge splicing an
   iroh stream to "that owner's data connection". An app server has no listener for the bridge
   to connect to, so the bridge sends a `bridge.incoming` notification carrying a ticket on the
   control connection, and the app server opens a data connection quoting it. One listener,
   one direction of connection, and a ticket that is useless to anyone who did not receive it.

## The shape of a connection

```
 app server                         bridge                        peer
     |                                |                             |
     |-- control: ipc.hello --------->|                             |
     |-- bridge.register ------------>|  routes.toml                |
     |                                |                             |
     |  --- outbound ---              |                             |
     |-- data conn ------------------>|                             |
     |   {"kind":"open", ws, device}  |-- iroh stream (ALPN) ------>|
     |<------ {"ok":true} ------------|                             |
     |========== raw bytes ===========|=========== raw bytes =======|
     |                                |                             |
     |  --- inbound ---               |<----- iroh stream ----------|
     |<-- bridge.incoming {ticket} ---|  (authorize the node id)    |
     |-- data conn ------------------>|                             |
     |   {"kind":"accept", ticket}    |                             |
     |<------ {"ok":true} ------------|                             |
     |========== raw bytes ===========|=========== raw bytes =======|
```

The replication protocol runs end to end between two app servers. The bridge decides *whether*
the bytes may flow and *where* they go, and never what they mean.

### Task 1: `sapphire-framework-bridge-api`

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api/Cargo.toml`
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api/src/lib.rs`
- Modify: `Cargo.toml` (workspace `members`)
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `lib.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `BRIDGE_NAME: &str = "bridge"`, `BRIDGE_DATA_NAME: &str = "bridge-data"`,
    `ALPN: &[u8] = b"sapphire/ws/1"`
  - method names `REGISTER`, `UNREGISTER`, `PEERS`, `STATUS`, and the notification `INCOMING`
  - `WorkspaceRegistration { workspace_id: GrainId, root: PathBuf }`
  - `RegisterParams { app_name: String, exe_path: PathBuf, managed_by: ManagedBy, workspaces: Vec<WorkspaceRegistration> }`
  - `RegisterResult { device_id: GrainId, node_id: String, workgroup_id: GrainId }`
  - `UnregisterParams { workspace_id: GrainId }`
  - `PeerInfo { device_id: GrainId, name: String, node_id: String, connected: bool }`,
    `PeersResult { peers: Vec<PeerInfo> }`
  - `RouteStatus { workspace_id: GrainId, app_name: String, root: PathBuf, owner_online: bool }`
  - `StatusResult { version: String, node_id: String, workgroup: Option<WorkgroupStatus>, routes: Vec<RouteStatus> }`,
    `WorkgroupStatus { workgroup_id: GrainId, name: String, devices: usize }`
  - `IncomingParams { workspace_id: GrainId, peer_device_id: GrainId, ticket: String }`
  - `DataHeader::{Open { workspace_id, device_id }, Accept { ticket }}` (serde tag `kind`)
  - `DataAck { ok: bool, error: Option<String> }`
  - `Ack {}`
  - `BridgeClient` — `connect`, `register`, `unregister`, `peers`, `status`,
    `incoming(&self) -> broadcast::Receiver<IncomingParams>`, `open_stream` and `accept_stream` (both returning `sapphire_ipc::RawStream`)

**Why a separate crate:** so that `sapphire-framework-server` can talk to the bridge without
linking iroh. Keep it serde plus `-ipc` and nothing else; a test asserts the manifest.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the manifest**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "sapphire-framework-bridge-api"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
description = "Control-plane protocol and client for the sapphire-framework bridge"
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
keywords = ["bridge", "ipc", "protocol", "local-first"]
categories = ["network-programming"]

[dependencies]
sapphire-ipc = { package = "sapphire-framework-ipc", version = "0.14.0", path = "../sapphire-framework-ipc" }
grain-id.workspace = true
serde.workspace = true
serde_json.workspace = true
thiserror.workspace = true
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["rt", "sync"] }
tracing.workspace = true

[dev-dependencies]
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros", "time"] }
```

Root `Cargo.toml`: add `"crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api",` to `members`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api/src/lib.rs`, at the bottom:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    fn round_trip<T: serde::Serialize + serde::de::DeserializeOwned>(v: &T) -> T {
        serde_json::from_value(serde_json::to_value(v).unwrap()).unwrap()
    }

    fn id() -> GrainId {
        GrainId::random()
    }

    #[test]
    fn registration_round_trips() {
        let params = RegisterParams {
            app_name: "sapphire-journal".into(),
            exe_path: "/usr/bin/sapphire-journal".into(),
            managed_by: sapphire_ipc::ManagedBy::Spawned,
            workspaces: vec![WorkspaceRegistration {
                workspace_id: id(),
                root: "/home/me/journal".into(),
            }],
        };
        let back = round_trip(&params);
        assert_eq!(back.app_name, "sapphire-journal");
        assert_eq!(back.workspaces.len(), 1);
    }

    #[test]
    fn an_open_header_round_trips_and_is_tagged() {
        let header = DataHeader::Open { workspace_id: id(), device_id: id() };
        let value = serde_json::to_value(&header).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(value["kind"], "open");
        assert_eq!(round_trip(&header), header);
    }

    #[test]
    fn an_accept_header_round_trips_and_is_tagged() {
        let header = DataHeader::Accept { ticket: "t-123".into() };
        let value = serde_json::to_value(&header).unwrap();
        assert_eq!(value["kind"], "accept");
        assert_eq!(round_trip(&header), header);
    }

    #[test]
    fn an_unknown_header_kind_is_refused() {
        let value = serde_json::json!({ "kind": "sideways" });
        assert!(serde_json::from_value::<DataHeader>(value).is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn a_data_ack_carries_its_reason_when_it_fails() {
        let ack = DataAck { ok: false, error: Some("no such workspace".into()) };
        assert_eq!(round_trip(&ack).error.as_deref(), Some("no such workspace"));
    }

    #[test]
    fn method_names_are_namespaced() {
        for name in [REGISTER, UNREGISTER, PEERS, STATUS, INCOMING] {
            assert!(name.starts_with("bridge."), "{name}");
        }
    }

    #[test]
    fn the_crate_stays_free_of_the_workspace_and_network_stacks() {
        let manifest = include_str!("../Cargo.toml");
        for forbidden in ["iroh", "sapphire-framework-workspace", "sapphire-framework-retrieve", "sapphire-framework-backend"] {
            assert!(
                !manifest.contains(forbidden),
                "sapphire-framework-bridge-api must not depend on {forbidden}"
            );
        }
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge-api`
Expected: FAIL — the crate has no types.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the protocol types**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge-api/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
//! What an app server says to the bridge, and how it says it.
//!
//! Kept separate from `sapphire-framework-bridge` so that an app server can talk to the

And the shared line handshake, in `bridge-api/src/lib.rs`:

```rust
/// Send `header`, read the acknowledgement, and hand back the stream ready for raw bytes.
pub async fn handshake_data<S>(mut stream: S, header: DataHeader) -> sapphire_ipc::Result<S>
where
    S: tokio::io::AsyncRead + tokio::io::AsyncWrite + Unpin,
{
    use tokio::io::{AsyncBufReadExt, AsyncWriteExt, BufReader};

    let mut line = serde_json::to_vec(&header)?;
    line.push(b'\n');
    stream.write_all(&line).await?;
    stream.flush().await?;

    // Read exactly one line without buffering past it, so the raw bytes that follow stay on
    // the stream.
    let mut reader = BufReader::with_capacity(1, &mut stream);
    let mut answer = String::new();
    reader.read_line(&mut answer).await?;
    let ack: DataAck = serde_json::from_str(answer.trim())?;
    if !ack.ok {
        return Err(sapphire_ipc::Error::Protocol(
            ack.error.unwrap_or_else(|| "the bridge refused the stream".to_owned()),
        ));
    }
    Ok(stream)
}
```

`BufReader::with_capacity(1, …)` is deliberate: a larger buffer would swallow bytes belonging
to the payload. Write a test for exactly that in Task 5.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge-api -p sapphire-framework-ipc --all-features`

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

### Task 2: The bridge directory and the single-instance lock

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/Cargo.toml`
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/{lib.rs,error.rs,dir.rs}`
- Modify: `Cargo.toml` (workspace `members`), facade
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `dir.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `Error::{Io, Ipc, Registry, Format, NoWorkgroup, UnknownWorkspace, AlreadyRunning, Config}`, `Result<T>`
  - `BRIDGE_DIR_ENV: &str = "SAPPHIRE_BRIDGE_DIR"`, `BRIDGE_FORMAT_VERSION: u32 = 1`
  - `BridgeDir { root: PathBuf }`: `open() -> Result<BridgeDir>`, `at(root: PathBuf) -> Result<BridgeDir>`,
    `node_key(&self)`, `lock_path(&self)`, `net_toml(&self)`, `routes_toml(&self)`,
    `status_json(&self)`, `log_dir(&self)`, `workgroups_dir(&self)`,
    `workgroup_dir(&self, id: GrainId)`, `devices_dir(&self, id: GrainId)`
  - `InstanceLock`: `acquire(dir: &BridgeDir) -> Result<InstanceLock>`, released on drop

`bridge.lock` means only "there must not be a second bridge". It is not an election: a process
that cannot take it connects to the running bridge and is done — no handoff, no follower state.

- [ ] **Step 1: Create the manifest**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "sapphire-framework-bridge"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
description = "Host-wide sapphire daemon: device identity, workgroup authorization and a switchboard to app servers"
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
keywords = ["bridge", "p2p", "iroh", "local-first"]
categories = ["network-programming"]

[features]
default = []
# The real peer transport. Off by default so a build that only needs the switchboard, or a
# test, does not compile iroh.
node = ["dep:iroh"]
# Loopback transport and fixtures for tests.
test-util = []

[dependencies]
sapphire-bridge-api = { package = "sapphire-framework-bridge-api", version = "0.14.0", path = "../sapphire-framework-bridge-api" }
sapphire-ipc = { package = "sapphire-framework-ipc", version = "0.14.0", path = "../sapphire-framework-ipc" }
sapphire-registry = { package = "sapphire-framework-registry", version = "0.14.0", path = "../sapphire-framework-registry" }
clap.workspace = true
dirs.workspace = true
getrandom.workspace = true
grain-id.workspace = true
iroh = { version = "1.2", optional = true }
serde.workspace = true
serde_json.workspace = true
thiserror.workspace = true
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros", "net", "io-util", "sync", "time", "process"] }
toml.workspace = true
tracing.workspace = true

[dev-dependencies]
sapphire-framework-bridge = { path = ".", features = ["test-util"] }
tempfile = "3"
```

Root `Cargo.toml`: add `"crates/sapphire-framework-bridge",`.
Facade: feature `bridge = ["dep:sapphire-framework-bridge"]` and the matching optional
dependency and `pub use`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

        // A pid that is certainly not running: pid 0 is never a user process.

```

The platform `process_is_alive` needs `libc` on Unix and `windows-sys` on Windows; add them to
the manifest the same way `sapphire-framework-ipc` does.

Write `error.rs` with the variants listed in the Interfaces block, `AlreadyRunning(u32)`
rendering as `another bridge is already running (pid {0})`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features dir`
Expected: PASS, 8 tests (7 on Windows).

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
git add crates/sapphire-framework-bridge Cargo.toml Cargo.lock crates/sapphire-framework
git commit -m "feat(bridge): lay out the bridge directory and keep it to one process"

### Task 3: The routing table

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/routes.rs`
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/lib.rs`
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `routes.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `Route { workspace_id: GrainId, app_name: String, root: PathBuf, exe_path: PathBuf, managed_by: ManagedBy }`
  - `RouteTable::load(path: &Path) -> Result<RouteTable>`,
    `replace_app(&mut self, app_name: &str, exe_path, managed_by, workspaces: &[WorkspaceRegistration]) -> Result<()>`,
    `remove(&mut self, workspace_id: GrainId) -> Result<bool>`,
    `get(&self, workspace_id: GrainId) -> Option<&Route>`,
    `entries(&self) -> &[Route]`

`replace_app` replaces every route of one application at once, because that is what a
registration is: the app server's complete current list. Nothing else touches another app's
rows.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use sapphire_bridge_api::WorkspaceRegistration;

    fn reg(root: &str) -> WorkspaceRegistration {
        WorkspaceRegistration { workspace_id: GrainId::random(), root: root.into() }
    }

one writing process: two app servers owning one workspace would be two writers of its files.

### Task 4: Workgroup and authorization

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/workgroup.rs`
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/net.rs`
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/lib.rs`
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `workgroup.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `Workgroup { id: GrainId, name: String, dir: PathBuf }`:
    `create(dir: &BridgeDir, name: &str, this_device: &str, node_id: &str) -> Result<Workgroup>`,
    `open(dir: &BridgeDir) -> Result<Option<Workgroup>>`,
    `devices(&self) -> Result<Devices>`,
    `this_device(&self) -> Result<Device>`,
    `authorize(&self, node_id: &str) -> Result<Device>`
  - `NetConfig { wake_on_sync: bool, relays: Vec<String>, discovery: bool }` with
    `load(path) -> Result<NetConfig>` and a `Default` of `wake_on_sync: true`,
    `discovery: true`, no relays

`workgroup join`, invites and pairing are **step 8**. `create` exists here because
authorization needs a workgroup and a device ledger, and without one nothing in this plan can
be tested.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]

    use super::*;

        devices.add("phone", Some(NODE_B.to_owned()), None).unwrap();
        assert!(wg.authorize(NODE_B).is_ok());

        assert!(net.relays.is_empty());
    }

```

`authorization_rereads_the_ledger_each_time` is the important one: revocation is a change to
the workgroup that replicates, and a bridge that cached the ledger at startup would keep
talking to a retired device until it restarted.

### Task 5: The peer transport trait, and a loopback that needs no network

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/peer.rs`
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/lib.rs`
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `peer.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `trait PeerStream: AsyncRead + AsyncWrite + Send + Unpin` with a blanket impl;
    `type BoxedStream = Box<dyn PeerStream>`
  - `StreamRequest { workspace_id: GrainId, node_id: String }` — the first thing sent on a
    peer stream, so the far side knows what was asked for
  - `#[async_trait] trait PeerTransport: Send + Sync + 'static`:
    `async fn open(&self, node_id: &str, workspace_id: GrainId) -> Result<BoxedStream>`,
    `async fn accept(&self) -> Result<(String, GrainId, BoxedStream)>`,
    `fn node_id(&self) -> String`
  - `LoopbackTransport` (feature `test-util`): a switchboard that connects transports created
    from the same `LoopbackNetwork`, so two bridges can talk inside one test process

Making the transport a trait is what lets Tasks 6 and 7 be tested without a network — and it
is the same shape the sync spec asked of the replication core, for the same reason.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn a_loopback_stream_carries_bytes_both_ways() {
        let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
        let a = net.transport("node-a");
        let b = net.transport("node-b");
        let ws = GrainId::random();

        let accept = tokio::spawn(async move { b.accept().await });
        let mut opened = a.open("node-b", ws).await.unwrap();

        let (from, asked, mut accepted) = accept.await.unwrap().unwrap();
        assert_eq!(from, "node-a");
        assert_eq!(asked, ws);

        opened.write_all(b"hello").await.unwrap();
        let mut buf = [0u8; 5];
        accepted.read_exact(&mut buf).await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(&buf, b"hello");

        accepted.write_all(b"world").await.unwrap();
        let mut back = [0u8; 5];
        opened.read_exact(&mut back).await.unwrap();
        assert_eq!(&back, b"world");
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn opening_to_an_unknown_node_fails() {
        let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
        let a = net.transport("node-a");
        let err = a.open("node-nowhere", GrainId::random()).await.unwrap_err();
        assert!(err.to_string().contains("node-nowhere"), "{err}");
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn a_transport_reports_its_own_node_id() {
        let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
        assert_eq!(net.transport("node-a").node_id(), "node-a");
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn closing_one_end_shows_as_end_of_file_on_the_other() {
        let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
        let a = net.transport("node-a");
        let b = net.transport("node-b");

        let accept = tokio::spawn(async move { b.accept().await });
        let opened = a.open("node-b", GrainId::random()).await.unwrap();
        let (_, _, mut accepted) = accept.await.unwrap().unwrap();

        drop(opened);
        let mut buf = [0u8; 1];
        assert_eq!(accepted.read(&mut buf).await.unwrap(), 0);
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features peer`
Expected: FAIL — the module does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the trait and the loopback**

### Task 6: The switchboard — control plane, data plane, tickets

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/{control.rs,data.rs}`
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/lib.rs`
- Test: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/tests/switchboard.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `Bridge`: `new(dir: BridgeDir, transport: Arc<dyn PeerTransport>, version: &'static str) -> Result<Bridge>`,
    `async run(self) -> Result<()>`, `endpoints(&self) -> (Endpoint, Endpoint)`
  - `BridgeBuilder`-style setters: `control_endpoint`, `data_endpoint`, `net(NetConfig)`
  - internal: `Owners` — which app is connected, and its `PeerHandle` for notifications;
    `Tickets` — pending inbound streams, single use, expiring

**Two rules the tests pin:**
- A ticket is consumed the first time it is presented, and a ticket nobody claims expires
  rather than holding a stream open for ever.
- Bytes are never inspected. The relay copies in both directions until one side closes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

    (client_a, client_b, ws, reg_b.device_id)
}
```

Put `Host`, `start`, `connect`, `introduce` and `pair` in `tests/common/mod.rs` from the start,
and `mod common;` from both `switchboard.rs` and `wake.rs` — Task 7 needs the same fixtures,
and copying them is how the two drift apart.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features --test switchboard`
Expected: FAIL — `Bridge` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the control plane**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/control.rs` holds `Owners` (app name → `PeerHandle` and
its routes) and builds the `Router` with the four methods. Key points, in order:

```rust
/// Which app servers are connected right now.
#[derive(Debug, Default)]
pub(crate) struct Owners {
    by_app: Mutex<HashMap<String, PeerHandle>>,
}

impl Owners {
    /// Remember how to reach this app server. A second registration replaces the first.
    pub(crate) fn connect(&self, app_name: &str, peer: PeerHandle) {
        self.by_app.lock().expect("owners").insert(app_name.to_owned(), peer);
    }

    /// How to announce an incoming stream to this app, if it is connected.
    pub(crate) fn peer(&self, app_name: &str) -> Option<PeerHandle> {
        self.by_app.lock().expect("owners").get(app_name).cloned()
    }

    /// Is this app's server connected right now?
    pub(crate) fn is_online(&self, app_name: &str) -> bool {
        self.by_app.lock().expect("owners").contains_key(app_name)
    }

    /// Drop an app's registration when its control connection closes.
    ///
    /// Its **routes stay** in `routes.toml`: that is how the bridge knows where a workspace
    /// lives when its server is merely stopped, and how `wake_on_sync` finds it again.
    pub(crate) fn disconnect(&self, app_name: &str) {
        self.by_app.lock().expect("owners").remove(app_name);
    }
}
```

`bridge.register` does, in this order:

1. parse the parameters;
2. `RouteTable::replace_app(...)` — which rejects a workspace another app already owns;
3. record the caller in `Owners`, keyed by `app_name`, with `ctx.peer.clone()`;
4. answer with this host's `device_id`, `node_id` and `workgroup_id`, failing with
   `Error::NoWorkgroup` if the host has not joined one.

`bridge.unregister` removes one route. `bridge.peers` reads the ledger fresh and marks each
device `connected` from the transport's live set. `bridge.status` assembles `StatusResult`,
with `owner_online` from `Owners`.

**A registration lasts as long as the control connection.** When it closes, the app is no
longer online — but its **routes stay in `routes.toml`**, because that is how the bridge knows
where to find a workspace whose server is merely stopped.

- [ ] **Step 4: Implement the data plane**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/data.rs`:

```rust
//! The data plane: one header line, then bytes.

use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

use grain_id::GrainId;
use sapphire_bridge_api::{DataAck, DataHeader};
use tokio::io::{AsyncBufReadExt, AsyncWriteExt, BufReader};

use crate::error::{Error, Result};
use crate::peer::BoxedStream;

/// How long an unclaimed inbound stream is held.
///
/// Long enough for a stopped app server to start (`wake_on_sync`), short enough that a peer
/// that vanishes does not pin a stream for ever.
pub(crate) const TICKET_TTL: Duration = Duration::from_secs(60);

struct Pending {
    stream: BoxedStream,
    created: Instant,
}

/// Inbound streams waiting for their owner to claim them.
#[derive(Default)]
pub(crate) struct Tickets {
    pending: Mutex<HashMap<String, Pending>>,
}

impl Tickets {
    /// Park a stream and return its single-use ticket.
    pub(crate) fn park(&self, stream: BoxedStream) -> String {
        let mut bytes = [0u8; 16];
        getrandom::fill(&mut bytes).expect("the system random source");
        let ticket = bytes.iter().map(|b| format!("{b:02x}")).collect::<String>();
        let mut pending = self.pending.lock().expect("tickets");
        pending.retain(|_, p| p.created.elapsed() < TICKET_TTL);
        pending.insert(ticket.clone(), Pending { stream, created: Instant::now() });
        ticket
    }

    /// Take a stream. A ticket works once; presenting it again finds nothing.
    pub(crate) fn claim(&self, ticket: &str) -> Option<BoxedStream> {
        let mut pending = self.pending.lock().expect("tickets");
        pending.retain(|_, p| p.created.elapsed() < TICKET_TTL);
        pending.remove(ticket).map(|p| p.stream)
    }
}

/// Read the header line, without consuming any of the bytes that follow it.
pub(crate) async fn read_header<S>(stream: &mut S) -> Result<DataHeader>
where
    S: tokio::io::AsyncRead + Unpin,
{
    // Capacity 1: a larger buffer would read past the newline and swallow payload bytes.
    let mut reader = BufReader::with_capacity(1, stream);
    let mut line = String::new();
    reader.read_line(&mut line).await?;
    serde_json::from_str(line.trim())
        .map_err(|e| Error::Protocol(format!("bad data-plane header: {e}")))
}

/// Answer a header.
pub(crate) async fn write_ack<S>(stream: &mut S, ack: DataAck) -> Result<()>
where
    S: tokio::io::AsyncWrite + Unpin,
{
    let mut line = serde_json::to_vec(&ack).map_err(|e| Error::Protocol(e.to_string()))?;
    line.push(b'\n');
    stream.write_all(&line).await?;
    stream.flush().await?;
    Ok(())
}

/// Copy bytes in both directions until either side closes.
///
/// The bridge never looks at what it is copying: the replication protocol runs end to end
/// between two app servers.
pub(crate) async fn splice<A, B>(mut a: A, mut b: B)
where
    A: tokio::io::AsyncRead + tokio::io::AsyncWrite + Unpin,
    B: tokio::io::AsyncRead + tokio::io::AsyncWrite + Unpin,
{
    if let Err(err) = tokio::io::copy_bidirectional(&mut a, &mut b).await {
        tracing::debug!("a relayed stream ended: {err}");
    }
}
```

The bridge's data listener then:

- reads the header;
- **`Open`** — look the workspace up in `RouteTable`; refuse if it is not registered here;
  resolve `device_id` to a node id through the ledger; `transport.open(...)`; send
  `DataAck { ok: true }`; `splice`;
- **`Accept`** — `tickets.claim(...)`; refuse an unknown or expired ticket with
  `"no such ticket, or it has already been used"`; send the acknowledgement; `splice`.

And the inbound loop:

```
loop {
    let (peer_node_id, workspace_id, stream) = transport.accept().await?;
    // 1. Authorize before anything else knows a stranger called.
    let Ok(device) = workgroup.authorize(&peer_node_id) else { drop(stream); continue };
    // 2. Whose workspace is it?
    let Some(route) = routes.get(workspace_id) else { drop(stream); continue };
    // 3. Park it, announce it.
    let ticket = tickets.park(stream);
    match owners.peer(&route.app_name) {
        Some(peer) => peer.notify(INCOMING, …).await,
        // 4. Nobody home: wake_on_sync (Task 7 of this plan wires it; here, log and drop).
        None => tracing::info!(app = %route.app_name, "the owner is not connected"),
    }
}
```

Step 1 comes before step 2 deliberately: an unauthorized peer must not be able to learn which
workspaces this host holds by watching which requests are answered differently.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features --test switchboard`
Expected: PASS, 4 tests.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

```

### Task 7: `wake_on_sync`

**Files:**
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/{control.rs,data.rs,lib.rs}`
- Test: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/tests/wake.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `Bridge` starts a stopped owner from `routes.toml`'s `exe_path` when a peer asks
  for one of its workspaces and `net.wake_on_sync` is on

**The exception that must not be forgotten:** a route whose `managed_by` is `Service` is
**never** started. That covers a privilege-separated server (spec §3), which runs as root and
which the bridge — running as the human user — cannot start any more than a CLI can. The
workspace is reported offline instead.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/tests/wake.rs`:

```rust
//! Starting a stopped owner when a peer asks for its workspace.

use std::sync::Arc;

use sapphire_bridge_api::{ManagedBy, RegisterParams, WorkspaceRegistration};
use sapphire_framework_bridge::{Bridge, BridgeDir, LoopbackNetwork, NetConfig, Workgroup};

// … `start`, `connect`, `introduce` as in switchboard.rs; factor them into
// `tests/common/mod.rs` and use them from both files.

#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn a_stopped_spawned_owner_is_started() {
    let marker = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let evidence = marker.path().join("started");

    // The "app server" is a shell that touches a file and exits.
    let exe = "/bin/sh";
    let args_marker = evidence.display().to_string();

    let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
    let a = common::start(&net, common::NODE_A, "host-a").await;
    let b = common::start_with_exe(
        &net,
        common::NODE_B,
        "host-b",
        exe,
        &["-c", &format!("touch {args_marker}")],
        ManagedBy::Spawned,
    )
    .await;

    let (client_a, ws, device_b) = common::register_both(&a, &b).await;

    // B's app server disconnects; its routes stay.
    common::disconnect_owner(&b).await;

    let _ = client_a.open_stream(ws, device_b).await;

    let deadline = std::time::Instant::now() + std::time::Duration::from_secs(10);
    while !evidence.exists() {
        assert!(std::time::Instant::now() < deadline, "the owner was never started");
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
    }
}

#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn a_service_managed_owner_is_never_started() {
    let marker = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let evidence = marker.path().join("started");

    let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
    let a = common::start(&net, common::NODE_A, "host-a").await;
    let b = common::start_with_exe(
        &net,
        common::NODE_B,
        "host-b",
        "/bin/sh",
        &["-c", &format!("touch {}", evidence.display())],
        ManagedBy::Service,
    )
    .await;

    let (client_a, ws, device_b) = common::register_both(&a, &b).await;
    common::disconnect_owner(&b).await;

    let _ = client_a.open_stream(ws, device_b).await;
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;

    assert!(
        !evidence.exists(),
        "a service-managed owner must be left to its service manager"
    );
}

#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn waking_can_be_turned_off() {
    let marker = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let evidence = marker.path().join("started");

    let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
    let a = common::start(&net, common::NODE_A, "host-a").await;
    let b = common::start_with_net(
        &net,
        common::NODE_B,
        "host-b",
        NetConfig { wake_on_sync: false, ..NetConfig::default() },
        "/bin/sh",
        &["-c", &format!("touch {}", evidence.display())],
        ManagedBy::Spawned,
    )
    .await;

    let (client_a, ws, device_b) = common::register_both(&a, &b).await;
    common::disconnect_owner(&b).await;

    let _ = client_a.open_stream(ws, device_b).await;
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;
    assert!(!evidence.exists());
}
```

These are Unix-shaped (`/bin/sh`). Gate the file with `#![cfg(unix)]` and note that the
Windows path is covered by the switchboard tests, which do not spawn anything.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the tests to verify they fail**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features --test wake`
Expected: FAIL — nothing starts the owner.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement waking**

In the inbound loop, where Task 6 logged "the owner is not connected":

```rust
None if net.wake_on_sync && route.managed_by == ManagedBy::Spawned => {
    // The ticket is already parked, and its TTL is what gives the owner time to start,
    // connect and claim it.
    if let Err(err) = wake(route) {
        tracing::warn!(app = %route.app_name, "could not start the owner: {err}");
    }
}
None => {
    tracing::info!(
        app = %route.app_name,
        managed_by = ?route.managed_by,
        "the owner is not connected; reporting the workspace as offline"
    );
}
```

```rust
/// Start a stopped app server.
///
/// Detached, with no inherited stdio: the bridge is not its parent in any useful sense, and a
/// server that outlives this call is exactly what is wanted.
fn wake(route: &Route) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut command = std::process::Command::new(&route.exe_path);
    command
        .args(["server", "run"])
        .stdin(std::process::Stdio::null())
        .stdout(std::process::Stdio::null())
        .stderr(std::process::Stdio::null());
    #[cfg(unix)]
    {
        use std::os::unix::process::CommandExt;
        // SAFETY: setsid is async-signal-safe and is the documented way to detach.
        unsafe {
            command.pre_exec(|| {
                libc::setsid();
                Ok(())
            })
        };
    }
    let child = command.spawn()?;
    // The server outlives us; do not reap it.
    std::mem::forget(child);
    Ok(())
}
```

Note the rate limit this needs and does not yet have: record the last wake per application and
refuse to start the same one more than once every few seconds, so a peer that reconnects in a
loop cannot fork-bomb the host. Add it now, with a test:

```rust
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn an_owner_is_not_started_twice_in_quick_succession() {
    let marker = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let counter = marker.path().join("starts");

    let net = LoopbackNetwork::new();
    let a = common::start(&net, common::NODE_A, "host-a").await;
    // Each start appends a line, so the file's length counts them.
    let b = common::start_with_exe(
        &net,
        common::NODE_B,
        "host-b",
        "/bin/sh",
        &["-c", &format!("echo started >> {}", counter.display())],
        ManagedBy::Spawned,
    )
    .await;

    let (client_a, ws, device_b) = common::register_both(&a, &b).await;
    common::disconnect_owner(&b).await;

    // Ten attempts in a row, as a peer reconnecting in a loop would produce.
    for _ in 0..10 {
        let _ = client_a.open_stream(ws, device_b).await;
        tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_millis(50)).await;
    }
    tokio::time::sleep(std::time::Duration::from_secs(2)).await;

    let starts = std::fs::read_to_string(&counter).unwrap_or_default().lines().count();
    assert!(
        starts <= 2,
        "the owner was started {starts} times; a peer reconnecting in a loop must not be \
         able to fork-bomb the host"
    );
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests to verify they pass**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --all-features --test wake`
Expected: PASS, 4 tests.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

### Task 8: The iroh transport

**Files:**
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/iroh.rs`
- Modify: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/lib.rs`
- Test: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/tests/iroh_transport.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces (feature `node`):
  - `IrohTransport::new(key_path: &Path, net: &NetConfig) -> Result<IrohTransport>` — loads or
    creates `node.key` at `0600`
  - `impl PeerTransport for IrohTransport`

**Read the API before writing this.** iroh is the one dependency in these plans whose surface
is not pinned by anything in this repository. Check `https://docs.rs/iroh/1.2` for the exact
spelling of `Endpoint::builder`, `SecretKey`, `Endpoint::connect`, `Endpoint::accept` and the
incoming-connection type before implementing, and adjust the sketch below to match rather than
forcing the code into this shape.

The shape the rest of the bridge depends on is only this: open a stream to a node id, accept a
stream and learn the caller's node id. Nothing else about iroh leaks past this file.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the tests**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/tests/iroh_transport.rs`:

```rust
//! Two iroh endpoints in one process, on localhost, with no relay and no discovery.

#![cfg(feature = "node")]

use grain_id::GrainId;
use sapphire_framework_bridge::{IrohTransport, NetConfig, PeerTransport};
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};

fn offline() -> NetConfig {
    NetConfig { wake_on_sync: false, discovery: false, relays: vec![] }
}

#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn a_key_file_is_created_once_and_reused() {
    let tmp = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let key = tmp.path().join("node.key");

    let first = IrohTransport::new(&key, &offline()).await.unwrap();
    let id = first.node_id();
    drop(first);

    let second = IrohTransport::new(&key, &offline()).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(second.node_id(), id, "the node id must survive a restart");
}

#[cfg(unix)]
#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn the_key_file_is_private() {
    use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;
    let tmp = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let key = tmp.path().join("node.key");
    let _ = IrohTransport::new(&key, &offline()).await.unwrap();
    let mode = std::fs::metadata(&key).unwrap().permissions().mode();
    assert_eq!(mode & 0o777, 0o600, "mode was {:o}", mode & 0o777);
}

#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn two_endpoints_exchange_bytes() {
    let tmp = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
    let a = IrohTransport::new(&tmp.path().join("a.key"), &offline()).await.unwrap();
    let b = IrohTransport::new(&tmp.path().join("b.key"), &offline()).await.unwrap();

    // Teach A where B is, since discovery is off.
    a.add_known_address(&b.node_addr().await.unwrap()).unwrap();

    let ws = GrainId::random();
    let accept = tokio::spawn(async move { b.accept().await });
    let mut opened = a.open(&b_node_id, ws).await.unwrap();

    let (from, asked, mut accepted) = accept.await.unwrap().unwrap();
    assert_eq!(from, a.node_id());
    assert_eq!(asked, ws);

    opened.write_all(b"ping").await.unwrap();
    let mut buf = [0u8; 4];
    accepted.read_exact(&mut buf).await.unwrap();
    assert_eq!(&buf, b"ping");
}
```

> The last test needs B's node id and address before B is moved into the task. Restructure it
> to capture `let b_node_id = b.node_id(); let b_addr = b.node_addr().await.unwrap();` before
> the `tokio::spawn`, and give `IrohTransport` an `add_known_address` that feeds iroh's address
> book — with discovery off, A has no other way to find B. If iroh 1.2 spells this differently,
> follow its API and keep the test's intent.

- [ ] **Step 2: Implement the transport**

`crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/iroh.rs`, in outline — fill in against the real API:

```rust
//! The iroh implementation of [`PeerTransport`](crate::PeerTransport).
//!
//! Everything iroh-shaped lives here. The rest of the bridge knows only "open a stream to a
//! node id" and "accept a stream and learn who called", so replacing this file would not
//! touch anything else.

use std::path::Path;

        let node_id = endpoint.node_id().to_string();

                use std::os::unix::fs::PermissionsExt;
                std::fs::set_permissions(path, std::fs::Permissions::from_mode(0o600))?;
            }
            Ok(iroh::SecretKey::from_bytes(&bytes))

`open` parses the node id, connects with the ALPN, opens a bidirectional stream, writes the
`StreamRequest` line naming the workspace, and boxes the stream. `accept` waits for a
connection, reads its remote node id, reads the request line, and boxes the stream. The
`(read, write)` halves iroh returns are joined into one duplex with `tokio::io::join`.

**Do not put authorization here.** The transport reports who called; the bridge decides.
Keeping the decision in one place is what makes the retirement test in Task 6 meaningful.

- [ ] **Step 3: Run the tests**

Run: `cargo test -p sapphire-framework-bridge --features node --test iroh_transport`
Expected: PASS, 3 tests.

A real-relay test is out of scope; if you add one, mark it `#[ignore]` and say in its doc
comment that it needs the network.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
git add crates/sapphire-framework-bridge Cargo.lock
git commit -m "feat(bridge): reach other devices over iroh"
```

### Task 9: The `sapphire-bridge` binary

**Files:**
- Create: `apps/sapphire-bridge/{Cargo.toml,README.md,README.ja.md,src/main.rs}`
- Create: `crates/sapphire-framework-bridge/src/command.rs`
- Modify: `Cargo.toml` (workspace `members`), `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Test: inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` in `command.rs`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `BridgeCommand::{Run, Status, Device, Workgroup, Workspace}` (`clap::Subcommand`)
  - `DeviceCommand::{List, Invite { name, ttl, workgroup }, Forget { selector }}`
  - `WorkgroupCommand::{Create { name, device_name }, Join { ticket, device_name }, List}`
    (`Invite` and `Join` are step 8 of the pairing plan)
  - `WorkspaceCommand::List` — read-only, per spec §1: the bridge knows what the workgroup
    holds; the owning app's CLI decides what this host keeps
  - `async BridgeCommand::dispatch(self, version: &'static str) -> Result<i32>`

`pair`, `workgroup join` and invites are **step 8**.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the manifest and the binary**

`apps/sapphire-bridge/Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[package]
name = "sapphire-bridge"
version.workspace = true
edition.workspace = true
description = "Host-wide sapphire daemon: device identity, workgroup authorization and sync routing"
license.workspace = true
repository.workspace = true
keywords = ["sync", "p2p", "daemon", "local-first"]
categories = ["command-line-utilities"]

[dependencies]
sapphire-bridge = { package = "sapphire-framework-bridge", version = "0.14.0", path = "../../crates/sapphire-framework-bridge", features = ["node"] }
clap.workspace = true
tokio = { workspace = true, features = ["rt-multi-thread", "macros"] }
tracing.workspace = true
tracing-subscriber.workspace = true
```

Root `Cargo.toml`: add `"apps/sapphire-bridge",` to `members`.

`apps/sapphire-bridge/src/main.rs`:

```rust
//! The host-wide sapphire daemon.
//!
//! Running it with no subcommand starts the bridge; every other subcommand is a one-shot
//! command against a running one.

use clap::Parser;
use sapphire_bridge::BridgeCommand;

#[derive(Parser)]
#[command(name = "sapphire-bridge", version, about)]
struct Cli {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    command: Option<BridgeCommand>,
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
    tracing_subscriber::fmt().with_env_filter(
        tracing_subscriber::EnvFilter::try_from_default_env()
            .unwrap_or_else(|_| "sapphire_framework_bridge=info".into()),
    )
    .init();

    let cli = Cli::parse();
    let command = cli.command.unwrap_or(BridgeCommand::Run);
    match command.dispatch(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")).await {
        Ok(code) => std::process::ExitCode::from(code as u8),
        Err(err) => {
            eprintln!("sapphire-bridge: {err}");
            std::process::ExitCode::FAILURE
        }
    }
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the failing tests**

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use clap::Parser;

    #[derive(Parser)]
    struct Probe {
        #[command(subcommand)]
        command: BridgeCommand,
    }

    #[test]
    fn the_subcommands_parse() {
        for args in [
            vec!["b", "run"],
            vec!["b", "status"],
            vec!["b", "device", "list"],
            vec!["b", "device", "forget", "phone"],
            vec!["b", "workgroup", "create", "home", "--device-name", "laptop"],
            vec!["b", "workgroup", "list"],
            vec!["b", "workspace", "list"],
        ] {
            assert!(Probe::try_parse_from(&args).is_ok(), "{args:?}");
        }
    }

    #[test]
    fn there_is_no_way_to_map_a_workspace_from_here() {
        // Placing a workspace on this host is the owning application's business (spec §1).
        assert!(Probe::try_parse_from(["b", "workspace", "map", "notes", "/tmp/x"]).is_err());
    }

    #[test]
    fn pairing_is_not_here_yet() {
        assert!(Probe::try_parse_from(["b", "pair", "create"]).is_err());
    }

    #[tokio::test]
    async fn status_against_no_bridge_exits_non_zero() {
        let tmp = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
        // SAFETY: set before any other thread reads the environment in this test binary.
        unsafe { std::env::set_var("SAPPHIRE_RUNTIME_DIR", tmp.path()) };
        let code = BridgeCommand::Status.dispatch("0.0.0").await.unwrap();
        unsafe { std::env::remove_var("SAPPHIRE_RUNTIME_DIR") };
        assert_eq!(code, 1);
    }
}
```

`there_is_no_way_to_map_a_workspace_from_here` and `pairing_is_not_here_yet` are scope tests:
they fail the moment someone adds a subcommand that belongs somewhere else, which is the
easiest boundary in this design to blur.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the commands**

`run` builds a `BridgeDir`, takes the `InstanceLock`, builds an `IrohTransport` when the
`node` feature is on, and runs `Bridge`. Taking the lock fails with
`Error::AlreadyRunning(pid)`, which `run` turns into a message naming the pid and exit code 1
— not an error, because "the bridge is already running" is the normal outcome of starting it
twice.

`status`, `device` and `workspace` connect to the running bridge over the control plane
(`SpawnConfig::disabled()` — asking about a bridge must not start one) and print. That now
includes `device invite` and `workgroup join`, which ask the running bridge rather than
working on the directory: the ticket names the address a joiner must dial, and only the
bridge holding the bound endpoint knows it. `workgroup
create` works directly on the directory, because there is nothing to ask yet.

- [ ] **Step 4: Note the repository convention**

`CONTRIBUTING.md`, in the layout section:

```markdown
- Library crates live in `crates/`; binaries that ship as part of the framework live in
  `apps/` (`apps/sapphire-bridge/`). An application with its own repository stays there.
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Note it in `ARCHITECTURE.md`**

In the crate table:

```markdown
| `sapphire-framework-bridge-api` | bridge 制御プレーンのプロトコルとクライアント（serde のみ・iroh 非依存） | ✅ |
| `sapphire-framework-bridge` | ホスト常駐デーモン本体（デバイス識別・workgroup 認可・交換台・iroh） | ✅ |
| `apps/sapphire-bridge` | 上記のバイナリ | ✅ |
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Run everything and commit**

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --all-features --locked
git add apps/sapphire-bridge crates/sapphire-framework-bridge Cargo.toml Cargo.lock CONTRIBUTING.md docs/ARCHITECTURE.md
git commit -m "feat(bridge): ship the sapphire-bridge binary and its CLI"
```

## What this plan does not cover

| Spec step | Left for |
|---|---|
| **Replicating the workgroup workspace itself** — spec §1 makes the bridge the app server of one app, the workgroup, using `-sync` like any other owner. Here the device ledger is only read and written locally. | step 8, when a second device first exists to replicate with. `sapphire-framework-sync` is deliberately **not** a dependency of `-bridge` until then: an unused one is noise. |
| `bridge log` and `status.json` | step 9, with the rest of the operational surface. There is no log file to read until then, and a subcommand that prints nothing is worse than one that does not exist. |
| Pairing, invites, `workgroup join`, `pair create/accept` | step 8 (`device invite` and `workgroup join` have since landed there; there is no `pair` tree — pairing is those two commands) |
| `Workgroup::this_device` finding the record by node id rather than taking the first | step 8, with `join` |
| The app server's sync runtime: watcher, `Replica`, `sync.enable` / `disable` / `status` | step 7 |
| Publishing the workgroup's workspace list (`workspaces/<id>.toml`) | step 8 |
| The embedded relay and relay URLs from the workgroup | step 9 |
| `service install` for the bridge | step 10 |
| `status.json` and the shared log file | folded into step 9 with the other operational surface |
| Several workgroups per host | supported by the layout; the CLI limit is lifted when someone needs it |
