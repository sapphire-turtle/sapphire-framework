//! `status.json`: what the bridge is doing, for anyone on this host to read.
//!
//! The file is rewritten every [`STATUS_INTERVAL`] and promptly when its content changes,
//! atomically: through a temporary file and a rename. A reader that caught a half-written
//! `status.json` would report nonsense at exactly the moment someone is trying to find out
//! what is wrong. When the bridge stops, the last snapshot stays in place — which is how
//! `sapphire-bridge status` tells you what the bridge was doing before it stopped.
