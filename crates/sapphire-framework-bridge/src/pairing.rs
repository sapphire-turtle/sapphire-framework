//! The `pair/1` protocol: how a new device joins a workgroup.
//!
//! Pairing is the one exchange that happens **before** workgroup membership exists, so it
//! cannot ride the ordinary connection path — that path is authorized with the device
//! ledger, and the joiner is not in it yet. It has its own ALPN ([`PAIR_ALPN`]) and its own
//! gate: the single-use secret an invite carries, which is handed over out of band.
//!
//! The flow is one request, one response:
//!
//! 1. the joiner sends a [`JoinRequest`] — the secret, the name it wants and its node id;
//! 2. the inviter redeems the secret, writes the device record into the workgroup ledger as
//!    a **local write**, and replies [`JoinResponse::Admitted`];
//! 3. everything after that — the record reaching the other devices, the workspaces the
//!    joiner may map — goes over the ordinary sync path, which is what makes a retry of a
//!    lost reply safe.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-p2p-sync-iroh-design.md` §3.6.
