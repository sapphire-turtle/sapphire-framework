//! The device ledger: one directory, one record file per device.
//!
//! A device's `id` is **persisted into content** — a journal entry's frontmatter
//! `updated_by` points at it, and the record's file is named after it. So
//! removing a device from the ledger is a tombstone (`retired_at`) by default;
//! only an explicit `purge` deletes a record physically.
//!
//! One file per record is what lets two hosts mutate the ledger at the same
//! moment without colliding: each writes its own file, and every mutation here
//! rewrites exactly one record.
