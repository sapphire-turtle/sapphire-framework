//! What an app server says to the bridge, and how it says it.
//!
//! Kept separate from `sapphire-framework-bridge` so that an app server can talk to the
//! bridge without linking iroh: Cargo unifies features across a workspace build, so a
//! feature flag on one crate would not have been enough.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-process-architecture-design.md` §4.3 and §5.
