//! One replication session over one stream.
//!
//! Both sides run this same function. It is symmetric: each sends what the other lacks and
//! applies what it is sent, and neither is a client.
//!
//! The exchange, in order:
//!
//! 1. `Hello` — format, workspace, replica id and the sender's version vector. A format
//!    mismatch, or a different workspace, ends the session with `Refused` before any state
//!    is exchanged.
//! 2. Every path state the peer's version vector does not cover, in pages of [`PAGE`], each
//!    page preceded by the content it inlines (64 KiB or less), then `Done`.
//! 3. `Want` for content that was not inlined, answered with a blob or `Missing`.
//! 4. `Settled`, once the sender will ask for nothing more.
//! 5. `commit_session` last. An interrupted session leaves the version vector where it was,
//!    and everything is simply resent next time; committing earlier would make the replica
//!    claim versions whose content never arrived.
//!
//! The exchange is one function, [`initial_exchange`], because two callers start here:
//! `run_session` finishes a session from what it returns, and `open_live_session` (in
//! `live.rs`) keeps the stream and applies `Live` pushes on it.
//!
//! # Why there are two end markers
//!
//! `Done` says "my pages are complete" and is sent as soon as they are queued, so the peer
//! can start asking for content without waiting for anything. That leaves a race worth
//! naming: a peer that has just applied a page and is about to send `Want` looks exactly
//! like a peer that needs nothing. A side that stopped reading at `Done` would therefore
//! drop the `Want` for every file over [`INLINE_LIMIT`] — and, with it, the file. `Settled`
//! closes the race. It is sent once the sender's want list can no longer grow (the peer's
//! pages are in and every hash asked for has been answered), so the receiver knows no `Want`
//! can follow, and both sides exit only after seeing the peer's `Done` *and* `Settled`.
//!
//! Content is addressed by its hash, so a page's inline blobs may travel in front of the page
//! that references them. They do: a receiver that had already applied the page would
//! otherwise ask for content that is on the wire, turning every inlined file into a `Want`
//! and a second copy of its bytes.
//!
//! # Writers
//!
//! Everything this side sends goes through one task, so the read loop never blocks on a
//! write. Two `run_session` calls facing each other would otherwise deadlock the moment both
//! wrote more than the socket buffer while each waited to read.
