## Background

Every app server today opens a live session with every other device that hosts the same
workspace: a full mesh, with one dial direction per pair (the lower device id dials). The
number of sessions grows with the square of the device count, and every device does the
same work on every change.

Upcoming features also need *one* device to act for the workgroup. Background work that
writes files into a workspace — embedding files that have no vector yet, and collecting
vectors nobody references (#188) — should run on one device, not on all of them.

The first draft of this spec named a single, manually chosen "central device". That was
dropped: a workgroup that moved from a central server (#90) to p2p sync should not grow a
fixed centre again. This spec instead follows OSPF's designated router (DR) and backup
designated router (BDR): every device computes, from what it can see, which reachable
device is the **primary device** and which is the **secondary device** for each workspace.
No device is fixed in the role, and losing one costs nothing but a re-election.

Unlike routers, desktops sleep, and laptops (and, later, phones) come and go. So the
election weighs two things: a manual **priority** (0 opts a device out) and a measured
**availability**.

## Decisions

1. **Elected, not appointed.** No setting names a device as primary. Users influence the
   election only through priority. Setting one device's priority above everyone else's is
   how to pin the role in practice.
2. **The election tolerates disagreement; the work it guards must be idempotent.** There is
   no consensus protocol. During a partition, each side elects its own primary device,
   and both run background work. That is accepted. The requirement moves to the work instead:
   everything #188 does must be idempotent and converge when two devices do it at once
   (content-addressed vector paths, last-writer-wins with no conflict copies under
   `embedded/`, GC that only deletes what a backfill would recreate). The cost of a
   disagreement is wasted compute, never lost or conflicting data.
3. **Per workspace.** Candidates for a workspace are the devices whose app server for that
   workspace is online. A device that does not run agent is never agent's primary device.
   So no workspace is ever left without a path.
4. **Non-preemptive, like OSPF.** A primary device keeps the role while it stays
   reachable, even when a higher-ranked device appears. The role moves only when its holder
   disappears. This is what keeps a sleeping-and-waking desktop from making the topology
   flap.
5. **Availability travels in Hello, not in the ledger.** Only reachable devices are
   candidates, and every reachable device can say its own availability. The ledger (synced)
   holds only what a person sets, the priority. Nothing measured is written into synced
   files, so measuring adds no sync traffic and cannot race a priority change.
6. **Words.** "Primary device" and "secondary device" (表示: 代表デバイス / 予備デバイス).
   "Master" and "central" were both considered and rejected. The first version used OSPF's
   "designated" and "backup"; #198 replaced them with words people outside networking
   read correctly, and "secondary" fits a device that relays all along rather than waiting.

## Data

The device record (`<workgroup root>/devices/<id>.toml`) gains:

```toml
priority = 1    # 0..=255; 0: never primary or secondary. Absent: 1.
```

`Device` gets `priority: u8` with `#[serde(default = "default_priority")]` (1). Default 1
means every device takes part. With #190, availability then keeps devices that sleep a lot
out of the role without anyone setting anything. Before #190 ships, ties on priority fall to
the device id.

## Hello protocol (bridge ↔ bridge)

A new ALPN, `sapphire/hello/1`, authorized by the device ledger exactly like the workspace
ALPN. Each bridge holds one long-lived Hello stream per connected peer and sends a message
every `HELLO_INTERVAL` (10 s) and whenever its content changes. Lines are capped at 16 KiB.
A dialer does not open a Hello stream before it has its own `Some(Hello)` to send (on iroh
the acceptor's loop is serial). A link that ends forgets its peer, including when its task
is aborted.

```rust
struct Hello {
    device_id: GrainId,
    priority: u8,                       // as this bridge reads its own ledger record
    availability: Option<Tier>,         // None until #190
    hosting: Vec<GrainId>,              // workspaces whose owning app server is online here
    primary: Vec<GrainId>,              // workspaces this device holds as primary
    secondary: Vec<GrainId>,            // workspaces this device holds as secondary
}
```

A peer is **reachable** while a Hello from it is less than `DEAD_INTERVAL` (40 s) old. When
the stream closes, the peer becomes unreachable at once.

A peer whose bridge predates this protocol never sends a Hello. Its device is not a
candidate. Its app server syncs as before (see "Mixed versions").

## Election (`sapphire-framework-bridge`, `election.rs`)

A pure function, run per workspace and driven by a stateful `Elector::step(now, &own,
&peers)`. The election re-runs once per Hello interval, not on every Hello arrival, so
failover lags by up to one interval plus the app server's dial interval.

```rust
fn elect(candidates: &[Candidate], promote: bool) -> Roles

struct Roles { primary: Option<GrainId>, secondary: Option<GrainId> }
```

- **Candidates:** this host and every reachable peer that lists `workspace` in `hosting`,
  with `priority > 0`.
- **Rank:** `(priority, availability tier, device id)`, highest first. A missing tier ranks
  below every tier.
- **Primary:** if candidates already claim it, the highest-ranked claimant keeps it, and
  the others drop their claims. Otherwise, if a candidate claims secondary and `promote` is
  set, the secondary is promoted. Otherwise, the highest-ranked candidate.
- **Promotion gate:** `promote` is true only for a workspace in which this `Elector` has
  previously seen a primary claim. Before that, primary is chosen by rank. A
  provisional secondary claim must not promote itself before the rank-elected primary has
  claimed, which would make the role flap.
- **Secondary:** the same rule over the candidates other than the primary device, using
  `secondary` claims.
- **Wait timer:** a bridge that has just started (or just started hosting a workspace)
  claims nothing for `DEAD_INTERVAL`, and while it waits it is left out of its own election
  entirely (it still hears its peers). This gives existing claims time to arrive, so a
  device that wakes up does not seize a role that is already held.
- **No star before a claim:** until this `Elector` has seen a primary claim in a
  workspace (its own claim included), it reports `Roles::default()` for that workspace,
  which means mesh. It still runs the election and publishes its claims as usual. On a cold
  start no one has claimed yet, and each waiting host leaves itself out of its own election,
  so hosts elect different hubs. A star built on those views would close working sessions,
  and with four hosts at the default priority it could leave one host with no session at all
  for about `DEAD_INTERVAL`. Once a primary claim exists, every host agrees on the
  primary device, so every non-hub keeps a path through it.

Each bridge then publishes its own claims in its next Hello. Two bridges with different
views can transiently disagree. The claim rule makes them converge in one Hello round once
they see each other, and decision 2 makes the disagreement harmless meanwhile.

## Control plane (`sapphire-framework-bridge-api` 2.1.0)

These changes only add things, so `API_VERSION` stays 2.

- `PeersResult` gains `roles: Vec<WorkspaceRoles>` (`#[serde(default)]`), with
  `WorkspaceRoles { workspace_id, primary: Option<GrainId>, secondary: Option<GrainId> }` for
  every hosted workspace, including entries where both roles are `None`. An app server talking to an older bridge reads
  an empty list and stays a mesh.
- `PeerInfo` gains `priority: u8` and `availability: Option<Tier>` (`#[serde(default)]`), for
  display.
- New method `bridge.device_priority_set` (`DEVICE_PRIORITY_SET`):
  `{ selector: String, priority: u8 }` → `{ device_id, name, priority }`, mirroring
  `device_retire`. An unknown or retired device is an error.

## CLI (`sapphire-bridge`)

```
sapphire-bridge device priority <device>            # show
sapphire-bridge device priority <device> <0-255>    # set
```

Like `device retire`: with a bridge running it goes through the control-plane method; with
none running it edits the ledger directly. The change is a write to the synced workgroup
root, so every device sees it at its next workgroup session. `device list` gains `priority`
column, plus the workspaces each device is primary or secondary for. The `availability`
column of `device list` belongs to #190.
The apps' flat `device` directive gains the same verb, pointing at the bridge as the other
bridge-owned verbs do.

## Sync behaviour (`sapphire-framework-server`)

The server gets roles from `bridge.peers()`, the call it already makes on every dial pass.
A pure function decides each pair:

```rust
enum Link { Dial, Await, Skip }

fn link(me: GrainId, peer: GrainId, roles: &Roles) -> Link
```

- A star requires a `primary` device. Roles with only `secondary` set, or with nothing set,
  mean mesh, and the existing rule applies: `Dial` only if `me < peer`, otherwise `Await`
  the peer's dial. The bridge reports no roles for a workspace until it has seen a
  primary claim there (see Election), so the star forms only around a device that has
  claimed the role, and a cold start stays a mesh until then.
- In a star, if this host is the primary or secondary device, the same id rule applies to
  every peer. They therefore stay linked to everyone, and to each other.
- Otherwise (this host is neither), a peer that is neither primary nor secondary is `Skip`.
  The primary and secondary devices follow the id rule.

Where the rule applies:

- **`dial_loop` and `sync_now`** filter peers through `link`.
- **Entering the star.** When roles appear for a workspace and this host is neither, live
  sessions with peers that `link` now skips are closed (`LivePeers::retain(..)`). Nothing is
  lost: the primary and secondary devices hold and relay everything.
- **Inbound sessions.** `run()` drops an announced stream from a peer that `link` would skip.
  Both ends compute from the same Hellos, so this is only a safety net for the moment their
  views differ.
- **Losing the primary device.** The secondary already holds a session with every device, so
  sync does not pause. The election promotes it within `DEAD_INTERVAL`, a new secondary is
  elected, and the next dial pass links to it. If no candidate is left, `roles` empties and
  the mesh returns.
- **Relay.** Unchanged. A reader already forwards what one peer sends to every other session
  (`fan_out(.., Some(from))`).

`SyncRuntime::is_primary(workspace) -> bool` is the hook #188 uses. It reads only the
cached device id and the last roles the bridge reported, and never registers anything.

Status: each workspace's sync status gains `topology: mesh | star { primary, secondary }`,
and `sapphire-<app> status` prints it.

## Availability (#190)

- The bridge records, once a minute, that it is running, in `<bridge dir>/availability.toml`
  as per-day minute counts for the last 7 days. If the wall clock has advanced much further
  than the monotonic clock between two ticks, the host slept, and those minutes are not
  counted.
- `availability = minutes up / minutes in the window`, mapped to a `Tier`: `≥ 99 %` → 3,
  `≥ 95 %` → 2, `≥ 80 %` → 1, below → 0. Tiers, not percentages, so small swings do not
  reorder candidates.
- A device with less than 7 days of history reports one tier lower than its measurement
  (floor 0). A freshly installed host does not outrank one with a long record.
- The tier is announced in Hello and shown in `device list` and the GUI. It is never written
  to the ledger (decision 5).
- Implementation notes: the days are UTC days, and the window is the last 7 of them
  (today included), starting no earlier than the history. Each tick credits the monotonic
  clock's progress, capped by the wall clock's and by two ticks, so sleep is not counted
  whether or not the platform's monotonic clock stops during it. With under an hour of
  history the tier is `None`.

## GUI (`sapphire-framework-gui`)

- Device rows: priority (editable, 0–255, through `bridge.device_priority_set`), the
  availability tier, and badges for the workspaces the device is primary or secondary for.
- Workspace rows: the topology line (`mesh`, or `star: primary X, secondary Y`).
- No confirmation dialog for priority changes: they can be undone at once and lose nothing.

## Mixed versions

- An old bridge sends no Hello. Its device is not a candidate.
- An old app server ignores `roles` and dials the mesh. New non-elected devices drop its
  inbound sessions while a star is up, but the primary and secondary devices accept them. So
  the old device still syncs, through them.
- An old bridge under a new app server: `roles` is empty, and the mesh is used.

## Error handling

- Bridge down, or no workgroup: `peers()` fails, and nobody is dialled, as today.
- No candidates for a workspace (all priority 0, or nobody else hosts it): `roles` is empty,
  and the mesh is used.
- A Hello that does not parse: logged once per peer, and that peer is treated as having sent
  none. It is never a reason to drop the peer's workspace streams.

## Testing

- **Unit, `elect`:** no candidates; priority 0 excluded; rank order; an existing claim
  survives a higher-ranked newcomer; secondary promotion; two conflicting claims resolve to the
  higher rank; the wait timer suppresses claims.
- **Unit, `link`:** every combination of me / peer × primary / secondary / neither, roles
  empty and present, both id orders.
- **Unit, availability:** tick counting, sleep detection (wall clock jumps past monotonic),
  tier mapping, the young-history penalty, the 7-day window rolling over.
- **Bridge:** Hello over the loopback transport — reachability, `DEAD_INTERVAL`, claims
  converging between two bridges with different starting views. `device priority` with and
  without a running bridge. A retired device is refused.
- **Integration (three devices, existing sync test harness):**
  1. With A primary, an edit on B reaches C, and B and C hold no session with each other.
  2. With A stopped, the secondary takes over, and edits still arrive with no gap longer than
     a dial pass. (Not enforced by a test.)
  3. A returns and does **not** take the role back (non-preemption).
  4. B and C, which the top-priority device does not host, elect among themselves and sync
     directly. Cross-workspace isolation is covered by the `Elector` unit test
     `a_peer_not_hosting_the_workspace_is_not_a_candidate`, because the test harness runs
     one workspace per host.
  5. With every priority at 0, the mesh is used.

## Out of scope

- Background work itself (embedding backfill, GC): #188, under decision 2's idempotency
  requirement.
- Picking candidates by anything other than priority and availability (network quality,
  disk space, battery).
- More than one workgroup per host (still rejected by `control.rs`).
