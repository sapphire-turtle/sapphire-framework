# sapphire-sync

[English](README.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

## What this is

sapphire-sync is a peer-to-peer file-sync application built on
[sapphire-framework](https://github.com/sapphire-turtle/sapphire-framework). It is the
smallest useful app the framework can carry: a sync-only reference app, in the
Syncthing style — `serve` runs the embedded server, and every other subcommand
is a one-shot client that talks to that server over the local IPC endpoint. A
bare invocation prints the help.

## Install

Install **one** of the two editions. Both put the same command, `sapphire-sync`, on
PATH: the desktop app's binary also runs every command of the headless one (`serve`,
`status`, `sync`, `workspace`, …), so it is a superset of it.

| Edition | For | How |
|---|---|---|
| Desktop app (`sapphire-sync-desktop`) | Everyday use, with the GUI | Installer for Windows, macOS and Linux |
| Headless (`sapphire-sync-headless`) | Hosts and servers without a GUI | Install script, cargo-binstall or cargo |

Installing both leaves two `sapphire-sync` commands; `sapphire-sync status` warns
when the one on PATH is not the one you ran.

### Desktop app: installer

Download the installer for your platform from [sapphire-framework's latest release](https://github.com/sapphire-turtle/sapphire-framework/releases/latest):
`sapphire-sync-desktop_<version>_x64-setup.exe` (Windows), `sapphire-sync-desktop_<version>_aarch64.dmg` (macOS) or
`sapphire-sync-desktop_<version>_x86_64.AppImage` (Linux). It puts `sapphire-sync` on your `PATH` and keeps itself up to
date; its first start asks to keep the app server running in the background, for the MCP
server and HTTP clients while the window is closed. Sync goes through Sapphire Bridge,
which has an installer of its own on the same release (`sapphire-bridge-desktop-*`).

### Headless: install script

```sh
# Linux, macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sapphire-turtle/sapphire-framework/main/install/install.sh | sh -s -- sync
```

```powershell
# Windows
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sapphire-turtle/sapphire-framework/main/install/install.ps1))) sync
```

This installs `sapphire-sync` together with `sapphire-bridge`, which it syncs
through, into `~/.local/bin`. See the
[install script's README](https://github.com/sapphire-turtle/sapphire-framework/tree/main/install)
for the options.

### Headless: cargo-binstall or cargo

```sh
cargo binstall sapphire-sync-headless
# or build it
cargo install sapphire-sync-headless
```

Either installs the `sapphire-sync` binary. (0.13 to 0.14 were published as the
`sapphire-sync` crate.)
`sapphire-bridge`, which it syncs through, is the `sapphire-bridge-headless`
crate (`cargo binstall sapphire-bridge-headless`; it was the `sapphire-bridge`
crate up to 0.23).

## Quick start

```console
$ sapphire-bridge serve &            # the always-on peer (sapphire-bridge app)
$ sapphire-sync workspace init --sync ~/Documents/notes
$ sapphire-sync serve &             # this host's sync node
$ sapphire-sync workspace show      # this host's workspace, then the workgroup's
```

Workgroups and devices are `sapphire-bridge`'s (`sapphire-bridge workgroup
create`, `sapphire-bridge device invite`, `sapphire-bridge workgroup join`); see
the framework repository's README. Since sapphire-framework 0.24 this app no
longer re-exports them. Its own framework verbs are `serve`, `status`,
`service`, `update`, `workspace`, `api-key` and `config`.

## How the pieces fit

This repository ships one command, `sapphire-sync`, in two editions — the
headless one and the desktop app, which runs the same commands: the app server
plus the CLI. The always-on
peer it talks to is the `sapphire-bridge` app; run exactly one
`sapphire-sync serve` per host. The server serves one workspace at a time
(`workspace select` switches it); the `SyncRuntime` mounts its replica and
registers it with the bridge; the app itself implements
nothing of the replication engine. The two may start in either order: a
server whose bridge is not running yet serves without sync and connects once
the bridge is up, and again after the bridge restarts.

## Status output

`sapphire-sync status` prints the framework's rows (app, version, endpoint) plus
this app's per-workspace rows — one line per synced workspace, rendered from the
live `SyncRuntime` — after a `bridge: not connected; reconnecting` line while the
server has no connection to the bridge.

## `.sapphireignore`

A `.gitignore`-style file that lives *inside* the workspace and is synced like any
other file. Built-in rule: the ignore file's own conflict copies
(`.sapphireignore.conflict-*`) stay excluded, so conflict noise never propagates.

## Conflicts

Concurrent edits resolve by keeping both versions: the loser is written beside
the winner as `<stem>.conflict-<replica-id>-<counter>.<ext>`. Nothing is
overwritten; conflicts are resolved by hand, the Syncthing way.

## The "no server is running" contract

One-shot verbs never start the daemon. When no server is listening they print
`no sapphire-sync server is running` and exit 1.

## Desktop app

`sapphire-sync-desktop` is the desktop edition. Its binary is also the CLI: run
bare it opens the window, and with a subcommand (`serve`, `status`, `sync`, …) it
does what `sapphire-sync` does. The window is a GUI client of the installed
services: it shows the framework's sync panel and never runs a server or bridge
itself, so closing the window does not stop sync.

On Windows it renders with Vulkan, because the DX12 device is lost whenever a
Remote Desktop session reconnects; elsewhere wgpu picks its usual backend. Set
`WGPU_BACKEND` to override this. If the app crashes at start on Windows (a
Vulkan overlay layer can do that), run it with `WGPU_BACKEND=dx12`.
