//! The app server skeleton.
//!
//! An application builds one of these, adds its own methods, and runs it. Everything a
//! sapphire app needs on the server side — owning the workspaces, answering `workspace.*`,
//! pushing events — is here.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-process-architecture-design.md` §4.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! static CTX: AppContext = AppContext::new("sapphire-journal");
//!
//! AppServer::new(&CTX, env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
//!     .extend(|router| router.method("journal.create_entry", create_entry))
//!     .run()
//!     .await?;
//! ```
//!
//! Application methods are named `<app>.<method>`. The framework owns `workspace.*` and
//! `server.*`; anything else is the application's.
