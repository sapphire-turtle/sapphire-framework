//! Two complete hosts, built from the real pieces.
//!
//! A *host* is a bridge, an app server and a workspace: everything a machine runs, and
//! nothing a machine does not. Two of them on one [`LoopbackNetwork`] are the whole
//! architecture in miniature — client → app server → bridge → peer bridge → peer app
//! server → files — which is what `converge.rs` exercises.
//!
//! Every piece is in this process rather than spawned. A spawned app server finds its bridge
//! through `SAPPHIRE_RUNTIME_DIR`, and that is one variable in one environment: two hosts
//! cannot hold two values of it, so two hosts cannot be two spawned processes. The bridge's
//! own `switchboard.rs` and `wake.rs` solve it the same way.
//!
//! Each test file is its own crate, so a fixture one of them does not use is reported as
//! dead code.
