//! One `LivePeers` per synced workspace: it holds the open sessions to peers, pushes a local
//! commit to all of them, and forwards what a session receives to every session whose peer

//! two sides of one pair agree on which stream survives — the one rule that keeps two
//! scheduled dialers from keeping two different streams alive.
