//! The replication session two sapphire-framework replicas run over a byte stream.
//!
//! One `Replica` per side, one bidirectional stream, and a framed exchange of version
//! vectors, path updates and content. This crate is the only place that knows the wire
//! format; it neither knows nor cares what carries the bytes.
//!
//! Two shapes of session are built on that exchange:
//!
//! - [`run_session`] — a one-shot catch-up. It returns once both sides are caught up.
//! - [`open_live_session`] — the same catch-up, then a stream that stays open: each side
//!   pushes what it commits and applies what arrives.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-15-p2p-sync-iroh-design.md` §3.7 and §4.2.
