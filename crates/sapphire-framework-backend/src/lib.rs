//! Async, GUI-facing backend over a workspace.
//!
//! GUIs (egui desktop, a future WASM frontend) should not call the synchronous
//! `sapphire_workspace::WorkspaceState` directly — its methods block and its
//! search takes a `&rusqlite::Connection`-style borrow that leaks storage
//! details. This crate hides that behind an `async` [`WorkspaceBackend`] with
//! two implementations:
//!
//! - [`LocalBackend`] wraps a local [`WorkspaceState`] and runs its blocking
//!   operations on the tokio blocking pool.
//! - [`IpcBackend`] forwards every call to the application's server, which is
//!   the only process that may open the cache.
//!
//! All emit [`BackendEvent`]s over a broadcast channel so a UI can refresh
//! reactively (see [`WorkspaceBackend::subscribe`]).
//!
//! The trait is `Send`/`Sync` and its futures are `Send`, which fits a native
//! egui app that holds a **concrete** backend and drives it with
//! `runtime.spawn` (the existing app.rs pattern). A `?Send` variant for WASM's
//! single-threaded executor is left to the frontend crate.
