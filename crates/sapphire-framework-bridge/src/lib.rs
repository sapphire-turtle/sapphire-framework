//! The sapphire bridge: one host-wide daemon per user.
//!
//! Apps run one server per app, each owning a cache that only one process may open. The
//! bridge is the piece that sits above them: it holds this host's device identity, knows
//! which workgroups the host belongs to, and tells an app server where its peers are. It
//! never looks inside a workspace — it routes to the app server that owns one.
//!
//! See `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-16-process-architecture-design.md` §2 and §4.
